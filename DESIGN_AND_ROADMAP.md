# Ruby LSP Rails design and roadmap

## Long term roadmap

The goal of this roadmap is to bring visibility into what we have planned for the Ruby LSP Rails addon.
This is not an exhaustive task list, but rather large milestones we wish to achieve.

Please note that there are no guarantees about the order in which entries will be implemented or if they will be
implemented at all given that we may uncover blockers along the way.

Interested in contributing? Check out the issues tagged with [help-wanted] or [good-first-issue].

- [Improve performance for running tests through the Test Explorer](). The majority of work for this will be in `ruby-lsp`, but it's impact will be felt more when working with Rails.
